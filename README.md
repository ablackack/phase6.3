# phase6.3
A Phase6 clone written in C++

This is a clone for the vocabulary learning program called "Phase 6". It is written in C++ and uses SQLite3 databases to keep track of your learning progress.

## Development
Feel free to help me develop it. First make sure you have SQLite installed on your system.
Link SQLite everytime you compile the main.cpp:

<code>g++ main.cpp -l sqlite3</code>
